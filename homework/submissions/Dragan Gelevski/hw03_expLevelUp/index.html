		<P> You're playing the latest Harry Potter videogame as an aspiring wizard, leveling up as you
complete various objectives and courses throughout Hogwarts. You are very close to
leveling up and you just can't wait to unlock that new transformation spell and
as luck would have it, you are next up to do a friendly duel with one of your classmates
in the Defence Against the Dark Arts class. You know how much experience you have and how
much experience is needed to level up, as well as the amount of experience that you
get when you win the duel.

Can you calculate if you'll level up after the duel?

HINTS:

Define a function called willLevelUp, taking 3 parameters - 

the current amount of experience - currentExperience,
the total experience needed to level up - neededExperience,
the amount of experience you get when you win - winExperience.

Based on these, determine if after the duel you will reach the next level and learn the
new spell. Return this as a result from the function.

EXAMPLES:

willLevelUp(1000, 1020, 40); - returns true as a result;
willLevelUp(25299546, 25299766, 400); - returns true as a result;
willLevelUp(2050, 3000, 600); - returns false as a result; </P>
